2.1 Minimal code changes to comply with Loadup utility v2.1; no new 
    functionality; code changes are simply that Loadup class AssetTypeMap
    is now called FlexAssetTypeMap. Also, in Mediator classes, many 
    instances of private access have been changed to protected.
2.0 Migrated to work with Loadup utility v2, the evolution of and 
    replacement for the StartupManager utility.  The demo has 
    consequently been renamed from StartupForAssets to LoadupForAssets.
    In addition, the demo now includes the loading of single assets as 
    well as a group of assets, concurrently if desired.

1.0 - Initial release. Requires StartupManager Utility version 1.5.
